# docker-cicd-nodejs-test

This is a test app that wraps a simple JavaScript Fibonacci-number-at-given-index calculator within:

- Multiple databases (PostgreSQL and Redis)
- TravisCI for testing and deployment to AWS
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk for hosting the app
- Differing Dev and Production environments

Overly complex doubtful functionality; perfect for learning.
